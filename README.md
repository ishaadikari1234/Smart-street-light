# Smart-street-light
## Overview:
The Smart Street Light System is a cutting-edge project that aims to revolutionize traditional street lighting by integrating advanced technologies to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall urban infrastructure management. This project combines Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and smart analytics to create an intelligent lighting network that adapts to real-time conditions and provides numerous benefits to cities, communities, and the environment.


## Used 
In this project I have used 
1) Arduino Uno Board
2) Jumper Wires
3) IR Sensors
4) LDR Sensor
5) LED bulb

## Features

- **Intelligent Lighting Control**: The system adapts lighting levels based on real-time conditions, using ambient light sensors and motion detection to optimize energy usage.
- **Remote Monitoring and Management**: Street lights can be remotely controlled and monitored, reducing maintenance costs and response times to faults.
- **Energy Analytics**: Advanced analytics provide insights into energy consumption patterns, enabling data-driven decisions for further optimization.
- **Smart City Integration**: The project seamlessly integrates with other smart city systems, contributing to holistic urban infrastructure management.
